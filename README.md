# to-do-list
A to-do list is a simple tool for organizing tasks, tracking progress, and managing priorities. It helps users stay productive by listing tasks that need to be completed, often with deadlines or priority levels. To-do lists can be digital or handwritten, and they improve efficiency by keeping work structured and manageable.
